# darcy-thompson-data
Code to replicate the harmonic analysis of periodic variations from monthly data done as part of the North Sea investigations at the start of the 20th century.

You will need the api key to fully run the code (or comment out coordinate mapping sections), which relevant people should have, but it's just a simple execution of the main.py file to produce the graphs with the data points from each month, along with their "graph of best fit" and the modified graph.

File structure for data: <br />
Line 1 : what is being measured <br />
Line 2 : the location that the ship comes from <br />
Line 3 : the location the ship goes to <br />
Line 4 : latitude that measurement was taken <br />
Line 5 : longitude that measurement was taken <br />
Line 6 : year measurement was taken <br />
Line 7 - 18 : the measurement for each of the months in order <br />
